# Data Acquisition Project

This project will give you some real-world experience in trying to get a useful dataset from a government agency – or trying to pry it out of the hands of its keepers, which may turn out to be a more appropriate description of the effort in some cases.

It is worth 20 percent of your grade, broken up into assignments throughout the semester.    

## Why we're seeking data

You’re helping us obtain data that will power an investigative reporting project being done by students at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism (working for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the college) in partnership with other universities (Boston University, Stanford University, University of Arkansas, University of Florida and the University of Oregon) and professional news organizations (NPR, Honolulu Civil Beat).

Your participation is critical to this project’s success!  The project is examining how some cities across the country may be responding to an uptick in homelessness by criminalizing things homeless people do out of necessity.  This includes: sleeping in cars, laying down on benches in city parks and begging for food and money.

By participating in this effort, we hope you will learn a great deal about how to figure out whether a government agency has data, and how to successfully negotiate for access.  This skill is one of the most valuable things a journalist can learn to do.

As part of the process, you'll also do some reporting that will help us understand any potential pitfalls with using this data, including flaws that could lead to inaccurate findings through analysis.

## The data we're seeking

You will be assigned a municipality (a city or county, typically) to get data from.

We’re looking for two different data sets from each municipality that may help us shed light on police interaction with people who are homeless.

### 311 data

Many cities and counties in the U.S. have 311 systems that citizens can use to report problems to the government or request non-emergency services.  Citizens call a phone number (311) or use an app to report problems. Some common reasons people call 311 include:

* Request to fix a pothole
* Snow removal
* Pick up a dead animal.     

The [Wikipedia page on 311 systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1) offers a good primer on 311 systems. Please note that the list of cities it says has a system is not necessarily accurate or complete.  

Here are some examples of 311 systems and the data they collect:

* Los Angeles | [311 Description Page](https://www.lacity.org/myla311)  | [311 data captured by system](https://data.lacity.org/A-Well-Run-City/MyLA311-Service-Request-Data-2019/pvft-t768)
* Baltimore | [311 Description Page](https://311services.baltimorecity.gov/) | [311 data captured by system](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Services/311-Customer-Service-Requests/9agw-sxsr/data)

In some cases, 311 data will be available through “Open Data” repositories maintained by a municipality.  Here are two examples of Open Data repositories.

* [Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/)
* [Los Angeles](https://data.lacity.org/browse)

Note: in some cases, a municipality may not call their system a 311 system.  If officials in a municipality tell you they don’t have a 311 system, ask if they have something similar: a way for citizens to report non-emergency problems, concerns or questions to the government.  

In most cases, this data will include the following information about each call:
* Date and time of call
* A column categorizing the call (i.e. pothole, street light out)
* Location (maybe address, maybe latitude and longitude, maybe both).

It might also include:
* The agency the call was assigned to.
* A text write up describing the call in more detail.
* The disposition of the call (i.e. pothole fixed, assigned to an agency, unfounded)

### Police call for service data

Every municipality that has a police department or sheriff’s office will keep data on how police operate on a minute-to-minute basis, often prompted by a call from the public, including calls to 911.  

Often this is called “calls for service” data and it’s maintained by either a police agency or a centralized communications agency that handles calls for police, fire and emergency medical response.

Here are some examples of “calls for service” data:
* [Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/911-Police-Calls-for-Service/xviu-ezkt/data)
* [Los Angeles](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/LAPD-Calls-for-Service-2018/nayp-w2tw/data)
* [San Diego](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-calls-for-service/)
* [New Orleans](https://data.nola.gov/Public-Safety-and-Preparedness/Calls-for-Service-2016/wgrp-d3ma/data)
* [Chandler, Arizona](https://data.chandlerpd.com/catalog/calls-for-service-2019/data/)

In some cases, this data might bundle police with fire and emergency medical calls.  It’s fine to obtain a dataset that includes all three of those.  Officials may be reluctant to give out data sets that contain medical calls because of exemptions in many states’ public record laws for that information.  If we need to, we may ask them to fill the request but redact information that is exempted from public records laws.  

In most cases, the data will include the following information:
* Date and time of call
* Location of call (address, latitude and longitude, and/or police district)
* Reason for call (usually a code of some sort, indicating possible crime being committed or other reason)

## Grading and Deadlines

This project is worth 20 percent of your grade, broken up into assignments throughout the semester.  Your grade does not depend on whether you successfully get the database.

Your grade does depend on whether you display a solid, steady, and intelligent effort that takes advantage of your journalistic skills, your knowledge of the law and the application of the approaches we discuss in class.

## Municipality assignments

You have each been assigned a single city, a small group of counties, or both a city and its surrounding county.  If you have multiple locations, you'll want to do some initial reporting, web research and phone calls to officials in each place, trying to determine if a) they keep the data we're requesting, b) if it's already been made public and c) how hard it might be to get.  We will jointly decide then to pursue one city.  

If you have only one city, don't think you're getting off easy.  Most of them are very large jurisdictions that might put up additional roadblocks for repoters.

* MX | Anchorage, Alaska
* BW | Washington, D.C.
* ACC | Daytona Beach, Florida and/or Volusia County, Florida
* SC | Charles County, Maryland or St. Mary's County, Maryland
* VD | Port St. Lucie, Florida and/or St. Lucie County, Florida
* CD |	Fort Walton Beach, Florida and/or Destin, Florida or Okaloosa County, Florida
* RF	| Monroe County, Florida and/or Key West, Florida
* MH | New Port Richey, Florida and/or Pasco County, Florida
* DK	| Punta Gorda, Florida and/or Charlotte County, Florida
* SM	| St. Petersburg, Florida and/or Pinellas County, Florida
* LM | Atlanta, Georgia

## This is a reporting project

This is a reporting project, not just a research paper. You will need to figure out whether the data you're seeking has already been published online.  You will need to do web research to identify the correct agencies to contact, and the people in those agencies to contact. But it will take a lot more than web research.  You will need to call people and email them to identify who keeps the data, what it's called, what's in it, and attempt to coax it out of them -- either with a public records request or without one.

We’re looking for “un-aggregated” data, not data that summarizes calls in some way.  For example, you may find a 311 data set online that has one row per type of call for a given year, summarizing the total number of calls for that type. We do not want that. When requesting data for this project, you shouldn’t immediately volunteer why you’re requesting data or share details of the project.  But during negotiations for access to data, you may find it necessary to share some details, and that’s okay.  

## Contact log

You will maintain a written log of your contacts as a Google spreadsheet.  This is an essential and vitally important part of this project. This log, which you will submit as part of your graded work on this assignment along with your final report, should include the following for each occasion that you reach or even attempt to reach someone for this project:  

* the person’s full name;
* his or her job title;
* the agency for which he or she works;
* the location of that agency;
* at least enough contact information so that you can find this person again later or so that someone else reading the log could find this person again (phone number, e-mail address or both);
* the date and time;
* and a brief summary of what transpired.  

Some of the people you deal with – say, the receptionists or assistants who first answer the phone – may not want to give you their names, but you can always try telling them that you like to keep a record of the people with whom you speak. Your thoroughness may be appreciated.  An inadequate log – especially one that does not provide enough information for someone reading the log to know precisely whom you contacted, how you contacted them, when you contacted them and what you discussed – may prevent you from getting a passing grade for this assignment.

## How to Identify Yourself

You should identify yourself as a data reporter for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, a non-profit investigative reporting unit in Maryland.  If someone asks if you're a student, tell the truth, but don't volunteer it.  The people with whom you are dealing with need to understand that this database could be used as the foundation for a news story.

## Request Letter

Do not send a request letter without getting it approved by me in advance.  When it's ready, I'll give you Howard Center letterhead to put it on for sending.

In most cases, you'll need to draft a public information act request letter to get the data, based on the laws of that state.  In order to draft a good request letter with a high chance of getting filled, you'll need to do a lot of reporting to learn if the data you seek exists, who keeps the data (the custodian), what it's called and what's in it, what might be exempt from disclosure and other information.  

You'll also need to familiarize with the law in the state and write a letter based on public records laws in the state.

When you do request the database, you will ask for a waiver of fees in any written request for the database. You will need to negotiate over this issue if the agency proposes to charge you for the data, and we will talk in class about how to do that. You are not required or expected to pay for this database yourself.

## Presentation and Slide Deck

You will make a verbal presentation to the class (5 minutes) on your project. During the presentations, we will discuss your experiences and what steps might help to pry the data from reluctant gatekeepers.  You should include the following elements, with exactly one slide for each one.

* About the database:  Describe the database you sought and whom you sought it from.
* About the law: How did you determine that these are public records?
* About the negotiation: Tell us about your contacts with the agency. Did officials put up barriers to access or accommodate you? Did they object to releasing the data in electronic form? What was the outcome?
* Looking ahead: If you have not obtained the data, what steps would you or someone else need to take to perfect the request?
* Lessons learned: What did you learn from this project that you might be able to apply to future reporting efforts and that would be useful for other students to know?  Did you learn anything about yourself? Your insights here are an important feature of the assignment.
